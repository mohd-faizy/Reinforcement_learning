    "### Mapping the Problem to a Markov Decision Process (MDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "An MDP is defined by a 5-tuple `(S, A, P, R, γ)`:\n",
    "*   **S**: Set of states\n",
    "*   **A**: Set of actions\n",
    "*   **P**: Transition probabilities `P(s' | s, a)`\n",
    "*   **R**: Reward function `R(s, a, s')`\n",
    "*   **γ**: Discount factor (between 0 and 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the Frozen Lake problem into these components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `States (S)`\n",
    "Each tile (cell) in the grid is a state. We can represent them by their coordinates.\n",
    "*   **S**: `{(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), ..., (3,3)}`\n",
    "*   The **terminal states** are the holes `H` and the goal `G`. Once you enter one, the episode is over. For example, `(1,1)` is a hole and `(3,3)` is the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `Actions (A)`\n",
    "The actions are the possible moves the agent can take from any state (if the move is possible).\n",
    "*   **A**: `{UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `Transition Probabilities (P)`\n",
    "This is the core of the \"Markov\" property. The outcome of an action is **stochastic** (non-deterministic). This mimics the slippery nature of ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Intended Action**: 33.3% chance\n",
    "*   **Slipping Left**: 33.3% chance\n",
    "*   **Slipping Right**: 33.3% chance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** From state `(0,1)` (a frozen tile), if the agent intends to go `DOWN`:\n",
    "*   With ~33% probability, it successfully moves `DOWN` to `(1,1)`.\n",
    "*   With ~33% probability, it slips and moves `LEFT` to `(0,0)`.\n",
    "*   With ~33% probability, it slips and moves `RIGHT` to `(0,2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a move would take the agent into a wall (e.g., moving `LEFT` from `(0,0)`), the agent simply stays in its current state. The probability mass for that invalid move is added to the probability of remaining in the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `Reward Function (R)`\n",
    "The reward defines the goal of the agent. We give a reward only when the agent reaches a meaningful state.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Reaching the Goal (G):** `R = +1`\n",
    "*   **Falling into a Hole (H):** `R = 0` (Some versions use a small negative reward like `-1` to penalize failure)\n",
    "*   **Stepping on any other Frozen (F) tile:** `R = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent gets this reward *upon entering* the new state `s'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "*   `R((2,3), DOWN, (3,3)) = +1` (Moving into the goal from above)\n",
    "*   `R((1,0), RIGHT, (1,1)) = 0` (Moving into a hole)\n",
    "*   `R((0,0), RIGHT, (0,1)) = 0` (Moving onto a frozen tile)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. `Discount Factor (γ)`\n",
    "This determines how much the agent cares about `future rewards` vs. `immediate rewards`.\n",
    "*   Let's choose **γ = 0.9** for this example. This means the agent strongly prefers reaching the goal quickly but still values eventually reaching it over never reaching it at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How an Episode Unrolls**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's simulate a few steps of a possible episode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Time t=0**: State `s₀ = (0,0)` (Start).\n",
    "2.  **Action a₀**: The agent chooses `RIGHT` (intending to go to `(0,1)`).\n",
    "3.  **Transition**: Due to slippiness, it actually slips and moves `DOWN` to `s₁ = (1,0)`. Reward `r₀ = 0`.\n",
    "4.  **Time t=1**: State `s₁ = (1,0)`.\n",
    "5.  **Action a₁**: The agent chooses `RIGHT` again (intending to go to `(1,1)` - a hole!).\n",
    "6.  **Transition**: It successfully executes the action and moves into the hole at `s₂ = (1,1)`. This is a terminal state.\n",
    "7.  **Reward r₁**: The agent receives `r₁ = 0` for entering a hole. The episode ends. The total return for this episode is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A successful episode** would involve the agent navigating the slippery ice, potentially getting lucky with slips, and eventually landing on `(3,3)` to collect a reward of `+1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Solution\" to the MDP\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of solving an MDP is to find a **policy (π)**, which is a strategy that tells the agent what action to take in every state (`π(s) -> a`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal policy `π*` is the one that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward (the **return**). In this case, it's the policy that has the highest chance of getting the agent to the goal without falling in a hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a small grid like this, we can compute this optimal policy using algorithms like **Value Iteration** or **Policy Iteration**. The result would be a map showing the best action for every tile:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Frozen Lake**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment Description:** An agent must navigate across a frozen lake to reach a goal while avoiding holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",

    "- **Terminal States:** Goal state (rewards +1) and hole states (episode ends) ~ 6\n",
    "- **Transition Probabilities:** Actions don't always lead to expected outcomes due to slippery ice\n",

    "✅ **Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\pi(a|s)$: Policy → probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$\n",
    "* $P(s'|s,a)$: Transition probability → chance of landing in state $s'$\n",
    "* $R(s,a,s')$: Expected reward for going from $s$ to $s'$ with action $a$\n",
    "* $V^\\pi(s')$: Value of the next state under policy $\\pi$\n",
    "* Captures **stochasticity in both actions and environment dynamics**\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **When to use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **real-world MDPs** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Multiple actions are possible\n",
    "  * Transitions are probabilistic (not deterministic)\n",

    "\n",
    "  * **Policy Evaluation** (compute value of a given policy)\n",
    "  * **Policy Iteration** (improve policies step by step)\n",
    "  * **Actor-Critic methods** (where the critic estimates $V^\\pi$)\n",
    "* Needed when using **model-based RL**, since it explicitly uses transition probabilities $P(s'|s,a)$.\n",
    "* Forms the foundation for **policy optimization methods** like Policy Gradient, A2C, PPO (where value functions are approximated).\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Example: In a **robot navigation task**, if the robot in state $s$ has a 70% chance to move forward and a 30% chance to slip sideways, this equation correctly handles those probabilities.\n",

    "✨ **Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expanded formula** → Good for intuition, teaching, and small toy problems. Used in Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    "* **Recursive Bellman formula** → Practical for computation, DP, and TD-learning. Efficient because it uses recursion instead of full sum.\n",
    "* **General Bellman with policy** → Realistic MDPs with stochastic transitions and multiple actions. Core of almost all RL algorithms."

    "| **Approach**           | Two clear steps: (1) **Policy Evaluation** – compute how good the current policy is (using $V^\\pi$), (2) **Policy Improvement** – update the policy to be greedy w\\.r.t. those values. These two steps alternate. | Blends evaluation and improvement into **one step** by directly updating the value function toward optimality ($V^*$) using the Bellman optimality equation.                                      |\n",
    "| **Convergence**        | Converges in a **finite number of iterations** (guaranteed to find the optimal policy after some steps).                                                                                                          | Converges **asymptotically**: values get closer to $V^*$ with each update but only *truly* converge after infinite updates. In practice, we stop once changes are very small (below a threshold). |\n",
    "| **Per Iteration Cost** | **High** – because policy evaluation usually requires solving or approximating a system of equations (can take many sweeps over all states).                                                                      | **Low** – each iteration just does one value update per state (using the Bellman backup). Much cheaper per iteration.                                                                             |\n",
    "| **Total Iterations**   | **Fewer** – since each iteration makes a “big jump” by fully evaluating the policy.                                                                                                                               | **More** – since each step is small and incremental. Needs many sweeps to reach near-optimal values.                                                                                              |\n",
    "| **Memory**             | Must store an **explicit policy** (mapping from states to actions) alongside the value function.                                                                                                                  | Policy is **implicitly derived** from the value function (choose the action that maximizes the next-state value).                                                                                 |\n",
    "| **Practical Use**      | Works best for **small or medium-sized state spaces** where exact policy evaluation is feasible.                                                                                                                  | Preferred for **large or complex state spaces**, since it avoids heavy evaluation and still reaches a good approximation.                                                                         |\n",
