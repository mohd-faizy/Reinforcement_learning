    "### 1.1 What is an MDP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making in environments where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker (agent). It's foundational in reinforcement learning and dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** MDPs provide a formal way to describe environments where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker (agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components of an MDP:**\n",
    "- **States (S):** All possible situations the agent can be in\n",
    "- **Actions (A):** All possible moves the agent can make\n",
    "- **Transition Probabilities (P):** Likelihood of moving from one state to another given an action\n",
    "- **Rewards (R):** Immediate feedback received after taking an action\n",
    "- **Discount Factor (γ):** Weight given to future rewards (0 ≤ γ ≤ 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Markov Property\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The Markov Property states that the future state depends only on the `current state` and `action`, **NOT** on the entire history of past states and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Expression:**\n",
    "$$P(S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s, A_t = a, S_{t-1}, A_{t-1}, ..., S_0, A_0) = P(S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s, A_t = a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intuitive Explanation:** The current state contains all the information needed to make optimal decisions about the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal of an Agent in MDP**\n",
    "  - The agent’s objective is to find a policy `𝜋(𝑎∣𝑠)` that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time. This is often formalized using:\n",
    "      - **Value functions**: Estimate how good it is to be in a state or take an action.\n",
    "      - **Policy iteration** and **value iteration**: Algorithms to compute optimal policies."
