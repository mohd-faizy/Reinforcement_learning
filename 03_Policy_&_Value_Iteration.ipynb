    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Convergence Guarantees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finite Convergence**: Policy iteration converges in finite steps\n",
    "- At most $|A|^{|S|}$ possible deterministic policies\n",
    "- Each iteration either improves policy or finds optimal policy\n",
    "- Strict improvement until optimality reached\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimality**: Converges to optimal policy $\\pi^*$\n",
    "- Final policy satisfies Bellman optimality equation\n",
    "- No further improvement possible\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Policy Improvement Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "For any policy $\\pi$ and state $s$, if we define a new policy $\\pi'$ such that:\n",
    "$$\\pi'(s) = \\arg\\max_a Q^{\\pi}(s,a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $V^{\\pi'}(s) \\geq V^{\\pi}(s)$ for all states $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof Intuition**: \n",
    "- Taking the best action according to current Q-values can only improve or maintain performance\n",
    "- If improvement occurs in any state, it propagates through the value function\n",
    "- If no improvement occurs anywhere, we have found an optimal policy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Per Iteration**: \n",
    "- Policy Evaluation: O(|S|³) for exact solution or O(|S|²) per sweep for iterative\n",
    "- Policy Improvement: O(|S||A|)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Complexity**: O(k|S|³) where k is number of iterations\n",
    "- k is typically small in practice (much less than $|A|^{|S|}$)\n",
    "- Often converges in just a few iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity**: $O(|S|²|A|)$ per iteration, where |S| is number of states and |A| is number of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "- **Guaranteed convergence** to optimal policy\n",
    "- **Often fast convergence** in practice\n",
    "- **Clear separation** of evaluation and improvement phases\n",
    "- **Finds shortest path** to goal (optimal behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- **Requires exact policy evaluation** (computationally expensive)\n",
    "- **May be slow** for large state spaces\n",
    "- **Requires complete model** of environment (transition probabilities)\n",
    "- **Memory intensive** for storing complete value functions\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Example Results\n",
    "\n",
    "For a FrozenLake environment, typical optimal policy might look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Optimal Policy: {0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 2, 7: 2}\n",

    "## 8. Key Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "- **Computationally efficient per iteration** – O(|S|²|A|) vs O(|S|³)\n",
    "- **Memory efficient** – no explicit policy storage required\n",
    "- **Flexible stopping** – can terminate early for approximate solutions\n",
    "- **Scalable** – works well with large state spaces\n",
    "- **Same optimal result** as Policy Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- **More total iterations** required for convergence\n",
    "- **Asymptotic convergence** – never truly reaches optimality\n",
    "- **Less intuitive** – policy changes implicitly\n",
    "- **Threshold dependent** – convergence criteria affects solution quality\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Value Iteration provides an efficient alternative to Policy Iteration by combining evaluation and improvement steps. While it requires more iterations, each iteration is computationally cheaper, making it particularly suitable for large-scale problems. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy, achieving the same result as Policy Iteration but through a different computational path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between Value Iteration and Policy Iteration depends on the specific problem characteristics: use Value Iteration for large problems where computational efficiency per iteration is crucial, and Policy Iteration for smaller problems where exact solutions and fewer iterations are preferred."
