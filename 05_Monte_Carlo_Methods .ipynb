    "  - Learns about a different target policy using data from a behavior policy (including replay of past data).\n",

    "### Monte Carlo Methods in Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monte Carlo (MC) methods are **model-free**, meaning they do not need to know how the environment works (no model of states or transitions).\n",
    "- They estimate the value of actions $Q(s,a)$ by **averaging the total rewards** (returns) collected over many complete episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **return** $G_t$ at a time step $t$ is the total discounted reward received from that time onward:\n",
    "  $$G_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\cdots = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$$\n",
    "  - $R_{t+k+1}$ is the reward at step $t+k+1$\n",
    "  - $\\gamma$ (between 0 and 1) is the discount factor, controlling how future rewards are valued\n",
    "\n",
    "- MC methods estimate the action-value function $Q(s,a)$ as the average $G_t$ observed whenever the agent visits state $s$ and takes action $a$:\n",
    "    $$Q(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}[G_t \\mid S_t = s, A_t = a]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Monte Carlo Methods Are Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "- They provide **unbiased estimates** of $Q$ values given enough episodes (they converge to the true values).\n",
    "- They are **simple to implement** because they update values by averaging actual observed outcomes.\n",
    "- They do **not rely on bootstrapping** (unlike Temporal Difference methods), so they don't update estimates using other estimated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- MC methods need **complete episodes** to compute returns — they update values only after reaching an episode's end.\n",
    "- Therefore, they work best on **episodic tasks** with clear end points, like games or robot tasks with defined goals.\n",
    "- They can be less efficient and more memory-heavy for **long or continuing tasks** because they store full histories of rewards and actions for each episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other simple real-world examples for Monte Carlo methods in reinforcement learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robot Navigation**: A robot explores a room trying different paths until it reaches a goal. After each complete trip, the robot looks back at the total rewards (like how fast or obstacle-free the path was) to improve its route choices. Over many trips, it learns the best paths without needing to know the map in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game Playing (e.g., Chess or Go)**: An AI plays many complete games. After each game ends, it reviews moves made and the final result (win/loss), updating how valuable each move was. This helps improve strategy over time by averaging results from many full games.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inventory Management**: A system manages stock levels in a warehouse. It runs through full cycles of ordering and sales (episodes) and updates decisions on how much stock to keep based on cumulative profit or loss measured at the end of each cycle."

    "- Collect random episodes by interacting with the environment.  \n",

    "- Update policy towards the optimal by improving Q-values over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Advanced Steps in Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Episode Generation  \n",
    "- Start from a random initial state in the environment.  \n",
    "- Follow the current policy (usually starting random) until the episode finishes.  \n",
    "- Record the sequence of states, actions, and rewards:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$(S_0, A_0, R_1), (S_1, A_1, R_2), \\ldots, (S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}, R_T)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Return Calculation  \n",
    "- For each time step $t$ in the episode, compute the return $G_t$ as the discounted sum of rewards from $t+1$ to the end $T$:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$G_t = \\sum_{k=t+1}^{T} \\gamma^{k-(t+1)} R_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate returns by working backwards from the episode’s terminal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Q-Value Update  \n",
    "- For every visited state-action pair $(s, a)$, update the estimate $Q(s, a)$ by averaging all returns $G_i$ observed on the $N(s,a)$ visits so far:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$Q(s, a) \\gets \\frac{1}{N(s, a)} \\sum_{i=1}^{N(s, a)} G_i(s, a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here,  \n",
    "  - $N(s,a)$ is the count of times $(s,a)$ occurred.  \n",
    "  - $G_i(s,a)$ is the return observed at the $i^{th}$ visit to $(s,a)$.\n",
    "\n",

    "- A custom grid world example shows states 0 to 5 with episode data displaying State, Action, Reward, and Return at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expanded Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment Setup  \n",
    "- The grid world has 6 states (0 to 5) arranged in a specific layout.  \n",
    "- Each state lets the agent choose among actions: Left, Down, Right, Up.  \n",
    "- Actions lead to immediate rewards (which can be positive or negative).  \n",
    "- Episodes end when the agent reaches certain goal states.\n",
    "\n",

    "| State | Action | Reward | Return |\n",
    "|-------|--------|--------|--------|\n",

    "- The return is calculated **backwards from the episode’s end**, summing rewards step-by-step.  \n",
    "- Each return represents the cumulative sum of all future rewards from that time step onward.  \n",
    "- Keep track of every state-action pair $(s, a)$ visited and associate these with their returns for updating value estimates."

    "**Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "- **Specific case 1:** If $(s,a)$ appears multiple times in episode, only use first return\n",

    "#### Every-Visit Monte Carlo:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "- **Specific case 1:** Multiple visits within same episode all contribute\n",
    "- **Specific case 2:** More samples per episode, potentially faster convergence\n",
