    "- Gymnasium is a toolkit for developing and testing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Think of it as a playground of ready-made environments where you can plug in your RL agent and test how well it learns.\n",
    "  - 🔹 Abstracts Complexity: Instead of writing physics simulations or custom rules for environments from scratch, Gymnasium gives you ready-to-use environments like games, robotic simulations, and navigation problems.\n",
    "  - 🔹 Benchmarking: Because everyone uses the same environments (e.g., CartPole, MountainCar), results are comparable across papers, tutorials, and experiments.\n",
    "  - 🔹 Unified API: Every environment has the same way of interacting with your agent (`reset()`, `step()`, `render()`), so your RL code works across different problems with little modification.\n",
    "  - 🔹 Evolution from OpenAI Gym: Gymnasium is the actively maintained successor to OpenAI Gym, with bug fixes, new environments, and compatibility with modern RL frameworks.\n",

    "### 4. Working with Gymnasium — Code Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 1. Creating and Initializing Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import gymnasium as gym\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create environment\n",
    "env = gym.make(\"CartPole-v1\", render_mode=\"rgb_array\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reset environment to initial state\n",
    "state, info = env.reset(seed=42)\n",
    "print(\"Initial State:\", state)\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "**CartPole State Example:**\n",
    "`[-0.044, 0.024, -0.043, -0.017]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cart position = -0.044\n",
    "* Cart velocity = 0.024\n",
    "* Pole angle = -0.043\n",
    "* Pole angular velocity = -0.017\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. Visualizing the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Render current state as image\n",
    "state_image = env.render()\n",
    "plt.imshow(state_image)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusable function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def render():\n",
    "    plt.imshow(env.render())\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "render()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 3. Performing Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Actions: 0 = Move Left, 1 = Move Right\n",
    "action = 1\n",
    "state, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"State:\", state)\n",
    "print(\"Reward:\", reward)\n",
    "print(\"Terminated:\", terminated)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "State: [-0.0435  0.2200 -0.0441 -0.3238]\n",
    "Reward: 1.0\n",
    "Terminated: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return values of `env.step()`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **state** → next environment state\n",
    "* **reward** → immediate reward (usually 1 per step for CartPole)\n",
    "* **terminated** → True if episode ends naturally (win/lose)\n",
    "* **truncated** → True if time limit exceeded\n",
    "* **info** → diagnostic info (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 4. Basic Interaction Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "terminated, truncated = False, False\n",
    "state, info = env.reset()\n",
    "\n",
    "while not (terminated or truncated):\n",
    "    action = 1  # Always move right\n",
    "    state, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\n",
    "    render()  # Visualize each step\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Key Concepts Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔁 Environment Lifecycle:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creation** → `gym.make()`\n",
    "2. **Initialization** → `env.reset()`\n",
    "3. **Interaction** → `env.step(action)`\n",
    "4. **Observation** → state, reward, termination flags\n",
    "5. **Visualization** → `env.render()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Important Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always `reset()` before a new episode\n",
    "* Handle **both `terminated` and `truncated`**\n",
    "* Use **seeds** for reproducibility\n",
    "* `render_mode` determines visualization style\n",
    "* Action/state spaces differ per environment\n",
    "\n",
